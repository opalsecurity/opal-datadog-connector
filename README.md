# Opal Connector for Datadog

## Overview

This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

To generate a connector using openapi-generator, check out the instructions on the [Opal Docs](https://docs.opal.dev/docs/how-to-create-your-own-connector) or the [Opal Connector Spec](https://github.com/opalsecurity/opal-connector-spec) repository.

### Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a `.secrets` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the following:

```
export DD_API_KEY=<your-datadog-api-key>
export DD_APP_KEY=<your-datadog-app-key>
export OPAL_SIGNING_SECRET=abcdefg
export DD_SITE=us5.datadoghq.com
```

You can find your Datadog API and APP keys in the [Datadog Integrations page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api). The Opal Signing Secret is generated when you create a custom app in the Opal Web UI. This is required to run this connector.

2. Run the server using the following command:

```
make run
```
